# Windows Context Menus

## What is this?
This is a small python script that generates a .reg file with the info you give the program (icon, default editor, etc). Once you execute the .reg file, the file extension will be added to your "New file menu".<br/>

## I don't trust you!
**Good!** Don't trust internet strangers. You should definitely read the ![wiki](https://github.com/margual56/WindowsContextMenus/wiki), which explains **everything**.

## But... why?
Once you do a good read of the ![wiki](https://github.com/margual56/WindowsContextMenus/wiki), you should be able to do everything manually, editing the register by hand. However, as you can imagine, that is a total waste of time and really boring. That's the only reason why I created this program.

## Resources
All the icons inside the ![wiki folder](https://github.com/margual56/WindowsContextMenus/tree/master/.wiki/icons) are free and you can use them however you like (Creative Commons, non-commercial please).
